## üéØ Project Goals
The primary objective is to build a live movie dashboard and recommendation system. This is broken down into the following key goals:

- **Data Engineering**: Ingest, clean, and structure the raw Kaggle dataset into a robust MySQL database, making it persistent and queryable.
- **Distributed Analysis**: Leverage Apache Spark and its DataFrame API to perform large-scale Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and complex aggregations that would be inefficient on a single machine.
- **Insight Generation**: Answer specific business-driven questions, such as identifying top-performing directors, financially successful genres, and high-profit-margin production companies.
- **System Development**: Build a functional, content-based recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.
- **Visualization**: (Goal) Create a user-facing UI (dashboard) to present the analytical findings and host the recommendation system.

## Data Preprocessing
Steps executed in Spark (spark_processing.sc):  
1. Null Handling: rows with nulls in critical analytical columns removed.  
2. Duplicate Audit: duplicate count check; duplicates eliminated if present.  
3. Zero-Value Filtering: removal of rows with nonsensical zeros in monetized or runtime fields.  
4. Profit Engineering: profit = gross ‚àí budget (used in company/star/country profitability rankings).  
5. Temporal Parsing: release date converted to year & month aggregates for longitudinal trend plots.  
6. Runtime Categorization: Bucketing relative to global mean for preference analysis.

## Analytical Methodology
Spark SQL & DataFrame API operations: groupBy(), agg(), avg(), sum(), count(), orderBy(), limit(), window functions.

## Recommendation Engine

<p align="center">
  <img src="image (27).png" alt="Patrol Robot" width="1000"/>
</p>

Type: Deterministic content-based filtering (genre/star/production house).  
Logic:  
- Movie-based: infer genre of selected title ‚Üí rank peers in same genre by score (top 5).  
- Star-based: filter by actor ‚Üí top 5 by score.  
- Production House-based: filter by company ‚Üí top 5 by score.  
Framework: Streamlit + PySpark session (movie_recommadation.py).  
Potential Extensions:  
- Collaborative Filtering (ALS) on (user, movie, rating) if implicit feedback derived from votes.  
- Hybrid fusion: content embeddings (TF-IDF over synopsis if added) + latent factors.  
- Diversity-aware re-ranking (MMR) & popularity bias correction.

Example Simplified Pseudocode:
```python
# Select Top-5 genre recommendations
genre = df.filter(col("title") == input_title).select("genre").first()[0]
recs = (df.filter(col("genre") == genre)
          .orderBy(col("imdb_rating").desc())
          .limit(5))
```

## Key Insights
1. Profit highly concentrated: a minority of studios account for disproportionate cumulative earnings.  
2. High average director score correlates with moderate but consistent runtime bands (no strong incentive for extreme length).  
3. Star profitability networks suggest repeatable casting strategies.  
4. Genre high-scorers cluster in quality-driven niches (e.g., Drama/Thriller) while high-vote films align with mainstream genres (Action/Adventure).  
5. Certification mix influences both volume and average score (stricter certifications show niche but sometimes higher score variance).
